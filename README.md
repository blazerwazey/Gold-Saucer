Gold Saucer is a Rust based file patching Randomizer for Final Fatasy 7 (Steam)

## Current Features include:
- Enemy Randomization (With Enemy Drops and Stat Scaling)
- Item/Weapon/Accessory Randomization
- Materia Randomization
- Key Item Randomization
- Shop Randomization

## Future Goals:
- Archipelago Multiworld Support
- Free Roam style mode

## Installation and Requirements:
- Download the latest version from Releases
- Install FFNx: https://github.com/julianxhokaxhiu/FFNx or install it via 7th Heaven: https://7thheaven.rocks (Highly recommended)
- Run Gold Saucer and point input to your root FF7 folder
- Set output to where you would like the files to generate
- Either copy the contents of Gold_Saucer<Seed> directly in to the FF7 folder or use 7th Heaven to pack Gold_Saucer<Seed> as an .IRO so your default files are not overwritten.
